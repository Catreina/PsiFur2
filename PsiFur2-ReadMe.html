            Installation Instructions
****************************************************

   Installation is designed to be quick and easy.

I will step through the process from extracting the zipfile to using PsiFur.

1) Extract the zipfile [$Filename] to whatever location you choose.
   PsiFur is designed to run correctly no matter what directory it
   is installed to, as long as the directory structure is preserved
   (every zip utility I have used preserves directory structure by
   default)

2) Load the PsiFur2.mrc file
    a) In the scripts dialog within mIRC
        1)  Alt+R or Scripts Editor
        2) Browse to where you extracted PsiFur.  If it was on
           C:\ this would be C:\PsiFur2
        3) Double Click the PsiFur2.mrc file
        4) Click YES to the "Initialization" window that will pop up.  
           Without allowing the initialization to process, the script
           will fail

    b) Command-line in any mIRC window
        1) Get the location where you extracted PsiFur.  If it was on
           C:\ this would be C:\PsiFur2
        2) Load the PsiFur2.mrc file by typing "/load -rs <path to PsiFur2>\PsiFur2.mrc"
           If you happen to extract to the main mIRC directory, you would type
           "/load -rs $mircdirPsiFur2\PsiFur2.mrc"
           Yes, there is NO slash - \ - between $mircdir and PsiFur2.  This
           is because mIRC returns $mircdir with a trailing slash.
        3) Click YES to the "Initialization" window that will pop up.  
           Without allowing the initialization to process, the script
           will fail

3) Once PsiFur2 is installed, it will add a menu item to your popups,
   so that you can easily access the user-friendly dialog.  Click on
   Commands->PsiFur2 v2.0.1b in the mIRC Menubar. On the dialog menu,
   if you click Help->Contents, it will display some useful
   descriptions of some of the options, and what they do.  One minor
   issue (if you got PsiFur2 from mIRCScripts.org) - crypt-all keys
   does NOT have 3 different options.  It is a static field that will
   have more options in a future release.

;****************************************************
;
;  Feedback is always welcomed, and right now is 
;  being requested for more features/bugfixing.
;
;  Planned for Next Release:
;    - Blowfish Encryption Algorithm
'
;    - Plugin Support For additional Algo's
;
;    - More return codes, error checking. There is 
;      already a slew of this, and input checking, 
;      in the DLL, and quite a bit in the script now,
;      just not enough for me...  yet
;
;    - Extensive Help file - currently in development
;
;    - Complete rewrite of the auto-updater - The current
;      updater is good, but I am not happy with it...
;
;    - Better random keyslot selection and checking.  See
;      below.
;    
;  Known issues/bugs:
;
;    - I know that the update feature locks up mIRC
;      for short time. I am working on this, and 
;      will accept any suggestions for fixing it.
;      If you look at the code, you will see that
;      there is already a timer involved.
;
;    - The use of random keys can generate errors, if the
;      key that is selected happens to be empty.  This will
;      cause the decrypt function to fail with a descriptive
;      error.  Because of this, random key selection is 
;      restricted to the (normally) static keyset of 0-9.
;      Again, if any of these become empty, the decryption
;      routine will fail.
